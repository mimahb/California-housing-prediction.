Predicting California housing prices using machine learning
## California Housing Prices Prediction

This project predicts California housing prices based on factors like median income and housing age using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the California Housing dataset, available in the `housing.csv` file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-prediction.git`
2. Run the notebook `housing_prices_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Results
The Random Forest model achieves an RMSE of 0.5 and an RÂ² score of 0.85.
